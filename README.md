# ScaleTech-Mecha

Built for GMTK Game Jam 2024.

In ScaleTech Mecha, players design, build, and scale mechs and their components to meet
customer provided requirements. However, with scale there is always a trade off, and the
player must manage these tradeoffs while still producing a mech that meets the desired
specifications.
